#Histograms

One other way to visually represent data is by inserting the data into a histogram chart. A histogram is a diagram consisting of rectangles whose area is proportional to the frequency of a variable and whose width is equal to the class interval.

First we will import the necessary packages:
```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)

```

Now we will use the following syntax to represent the data in a histogram chart:
```{r}
query<-"SELECT weight FROM Master"

result<-sqldf(query)

ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(data=result,aes(x=weight),color="black",fill="red",bins=50)+
  ggtitle("Body-Weight Distribution for Baseball Players")
```
