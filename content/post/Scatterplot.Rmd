#Scatterplots

Another way to visually represent data is by using a scatterplot. A scatterplot is a type of plot or mathematical diagram using Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data.

First we will import the necessary packages:
```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(devtools)
library(ggplot2)

```

Next we will extract the data: 
```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS career_HR,
sum(SO) AS career_SO FROM Batting 
GROUP BY playerID HAVING sum(HR)>=400"

result<-sqldf(query)
```

And now we will visualize said data: 
```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=career_SO,y=career_HR), size=3,color="red")+
  ggtitle("Career Strikeouts v. Homeruns for Great Hitters")+
  xlab("Career Strikeouts")+
  ylab("Career Homeruns")
```
